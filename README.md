# graphics-beginnings
The goal of this project is to get more into graphics programming and a bit of game development.
<br>
Since I do not have to much experience here, it will probably contain simple experiments and a lot of exercises might follow or be inspired by tutorials.
<br>
Currently I have 3 subgoals, the list might be extended thought.
1. Cube Marching - inspired by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ), for the video see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3iI2l0ltbE)
2. A world generated by fractals
3. Ray Marching

<br>
And future goals might be (just noted for now, so I don't forget them)
1. "Chaos equations" - inspired by [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrv269YwJzuZL3dH5PCgxUw), for the video see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDSIRXmnVvk)
2. Boids
