# Marching Cubes
The goal of this project is to learn more about Unity and how to generate a world using marching cubes and a function (e.g. noise).

I will have to learn how to generate meshes from code and probably how to write shaders in Unity, since I might need more performance once I
move from a small test area to an infinite world.
